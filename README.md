# Automated Joining Station

## Overview
The **Automated Joining Station** is a high-precision assembly system designed for automated component joining in industrial applications. Inspired by Festo's industrial systems, the station minimizes manual intervention and ensures precise alignment and placement of components. This system is ideal for applications in electronics and automotive industries, where high accuracy and repeatability are critical.

## Key Features
- **High-Precision Alignment**: Uses optical sensors and pneumatic actuators for precise positioning of components.
- **Automated Joining**: Automatically joins components with minimal physical involvement, improving efficiency and reducing human error.
- **Compact Design**: A space-efficient solution that integrates seamlessly into existing assembly lines.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Allows for easy control and monitoring of the joining process.

## Components
- **Sensors**:
  - **Photoelectric Sensors**: Detect the position and alignment of components.
  - **Diffuse Reflective Optical Sensors**: Ensure correct orientation of components during the joining process.
- **Actuators**:
  - **Vacuum Suction Cups**: Hold components in place during assembly.
  - **Compact Cylinders**: Provide precise movement of components.
- **Control System**:
  - **PLC (Programmable Logic Controller)**: Manages the sensors, actuators, and overall process.
  - **Pneumatic Systems**: Control the movement and positioning of components during joining.
